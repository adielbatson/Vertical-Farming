# Vertical-Farming

This repository holds the fundamentals in code and organization that goes into planning a vertical farming constellation. As a group, we developed a prototype unit for testing in a room with volume 10m x 10m x 3m. 

### Softawre Packages Used
- ´Arduino´ IDE (calibrating and setting threshold values for sensors; pH, Conductivity, Light quality, and actuators. 
- `Tinkercad` (Designing the prototype in 3D, and generally exploring design possibilities)
- Fusion 360 (3D printing small parts)
