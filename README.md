# Vertical-Farming Respository Abstract

This repository holds the fundamentals in code and organization that goes into planning a vertical farming constellation. As a group, we developed a prototype unit for testing in a room with volume 10m x 10m x 3m. 

### Softawre Packages Used
- `Arduino` IDE (calibrating and setting threshold values for sensors; pH, Conductivity, Light quality, and actuators. 
- `Tinkercad` (Designing the prototype in 3D, and generally exploring design possibilities)
- `Fusion 360` (3D printing small parts (in tandem with Tinkercad)

### Reflection
It was a great learning experience to be able to work on such a project. In a global context of food security and all that entails, within a chagning clmate, changing population dynamics  etc. the role of VF is increasingly important. I think the design parameters can be manipulated a great deal, depending on the crop type grown. The biggest drawback perhaps is the estimated power demand of the project to run, and other Vertical farm installations. These things (when designed with LEDS and actuators) can draw large of amounts of power. Nonetheless, key paramaters to pay attention to when designing:
- yield
- energy use
- ease of maintainability
- water efficiency
- scaffolding and scalable stability
- Structure modularity and scalability
- Complexity in managing & harvesting
- degree of automation

Good vertical farm systems address theses parameters, great systems master them!

Enjoi!
